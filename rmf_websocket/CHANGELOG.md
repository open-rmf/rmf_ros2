## Changelog for package rmf_websocket

2.1.2 (2022-10-10)
------------------
* Add find_package for vendored project.
  The vendor package for nlohmann_json_schema_validator was previously
  exporting dependency info for that package, however that is not the
  recommended workflow for vendor packages which are ideally as
  transparent as possible.

2.1.0 (2022-10-03)

* Initial release
