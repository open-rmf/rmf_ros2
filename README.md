# RMF <-> ROS2 Integration packages

To create a useful deployment, the RMF nodes must be connected to many other subsystems, as shown in the following diagram.

![integration-diagram](/docs/rmf_core_integration_diagram.png)

The `rmf_ros2` packages integrate the core algorithms and data structures of RMF into a ROS2-based distributed system.

All packages in this repo will be written on top of ROS 2.
